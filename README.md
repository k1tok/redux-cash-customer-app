## Introduction

A project to help understand the basic concepts of Redux, including reducers, actions, useDispatch/useSelector, combining reducers, Redux DevTools, array handling, Redux Thunk, and asynchronous actions.

## Features

- State management with Redux
- Use of `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks for accessing and manipulating state
- Combining multiple reducers with `combineReducers`
- Handling asynchronous actions with Redux Thunk
- Integration with Redux DevTools for state inspection and debugging
- Basic array handling in reducers

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redux-basics-project.git
cd redux-basics-project
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the project locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
```

## Concepts Covered

- Reducers: Functions that handle state transitions based on actions.
- Actions: Objects that describe what happened and may contain data to update the state.
- useDispatch/useSelector: Hooks to interact with the Redux store in functional React components.
- CombineReducers: Utility to merge multiple reducers into a single reducer function.
- Redux DevTools: A powerful tool for inspecting Redux state changes and debugging.
- Array Handling: Techniques for manipulating arrays within Redux state.
- Redux Thunk: Middleware to handle asynchronous operations in Redux.
